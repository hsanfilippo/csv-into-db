# csv-into-db
A module to convert and transfer a .csv file into a PostgreSQL table using Python.

### About
I started creating this module from a problem I encountered while beginning a CRUD project using food data. 

In the '.csv' file I am using to build my database, I had issues with the names of the foods. There were commas and double quotes that were breaking my code when separating the columns to insert into the DB. To fix this, I am creating some scripts that can adjust this and any other '.csv' file to convert the spreadsheet into a PostgreSQL table. 

Due to my limited time studying programming and my lack of real experience with Python, you probably won't see the best code ever written, but you will definitely see someone doing their best to solve a real problem. :D
